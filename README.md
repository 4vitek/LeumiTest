# Leumi task

I've made a simple express server. </br>
Clone or download this project. </br>
Type the '<b>npm install</b>' command. </br>
Insert these url addresses in your browser: </br>
http://localhost:3000/weather </br>
or just default http://localhost:3000 </br> 
You will get a json response with desired data. </br>
The report.csv file with the data will appear in a [PROJECT_NAME]/csv folder. </br> </br>

Good luck.
